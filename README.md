# Active, maintained or intermediate active projects
This personal folder is for my projects which are in the 'active', 'maintained' or 'intermediate active' states.<br>
Go [here](https://github.com/8BtS-A-to-IA) for project list.
- Definitions:
  - Active: Work on the project is healthy and alive. Expect constant maintenance.
  
  - Maintained: Work on the project is being maintained but not actively. Expect maintenance to be done at some point with some delay.
  
  - Intermediate Active: Work on the project will start and stop randomly. Expect maintenance to be done at some point but expect long delays. (these projects are usually last on my 'list to check/update')
